    </ul>

  <h3>Quiz bowl</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    <ul> 
      What quizbowl does is encourage students to appreciate knowledge and learning
      and it does so by having students answer pyramidal questions in a competitive 
      atmosphere. At Arapahoe, there are different quizbowl tournaments dedicated to 
      different subject areas, ranging from the humanities to the Natural Sciences.
      In particular, I was involved with the history bowl team.
    </ul>
    </p>

      <li> 2.   Semifinalist in JV state bowl competition sophomore year 
      <li> 3.   Second place in JV state bee competition sophomore year 
      <li> 4.   Qualified for state bowl (Varsity) finals Junior year

    </p>

  <h3>Community Service</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
    I think that volunteering is not only a great way to give back to the community, but it’s also a great way to encourage others to do the same. Moreover, it can be a great way to learn about yourself, others, and world around you. In particular, I think volunteering gets me out of my personal “bubble”: middle class, suburbs, and good public schools; and gives me a window into the lives of the underprivileged and an unobstructed view of the prevalence of poverty in the denver-metro area. As a part of the key club, I got to participate in the “sweet dreams in a bag” charity and got to pack bedding and comforters for kids that lacked the proper
    materials. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I participated in Key Club (9,11) </li>
      <li>I volunteer at the University of Colorado Hospital for around 3 hours on sundays. (2016-2017)   (grades 11, 12) </li>
      <li>In total, I have volunteered for at least 94 hours at the hospital, University of Colorado Hospital - Anschutz </li>
      <li>Volunteered for at least 12 1/2 hours for the key club </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Academic Accomplishments</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
           While my GPA is 3.2 (not very impressive) I have taken many difficult courses at AHS
     my first semester included medicine class (a zero hour course) and 3 AP classes + 
     dual enrollment credit course at ACC. These were by no means easy classes, and I spent a 
     great deal of my time studying for them.
    </p>
       <li> 1. I have made the honor roll at my high school, Arapahoe High School. (9,11,12)
       <li> 2. I have received an academic letter at AHS (11) 
       <li> 3. I was inducted in the NHS (12) 
       <li> 4. My GPA is currently a 3.2 (B "average")
